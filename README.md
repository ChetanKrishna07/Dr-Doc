# Dr-Doc
<h1 align="center"> Dr. Doc </h1>

## Introduction

To create a platform where patients can match doctors depending on their illness. A doctor can send prescriptions to patients and a patient can send their medical history to doctors. These medical histories are also stored in the patients' database, so other doctors can view them during examination and treatment of the patient. There will be unique accounts for doctors as well as for patient, linked with their email and/or phone number. It is an ML based system, where a patient can find out what doctors they have to consult. This consultation will be provided after the patients input their symptoms and problems. Patients can find pharmacies to buy medicines, and diagnostic centers to get their tests done in the same platform, making it holistic.
